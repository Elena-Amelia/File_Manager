- If your directory name or filename has spaces, it has to be in double or single quotes, like in examples:   
cd D:/"first directory"     
cd D:/'first directory/second directory'   
rn 'wrong filename' 'proper filename'   
cat 'text 1'.txt   
- In compress/decompress commands you need to write filename in path_to_destination, examples:   
compress text.txt arсhive.br   
decompress d:/arсhive.br c:/text.txt
